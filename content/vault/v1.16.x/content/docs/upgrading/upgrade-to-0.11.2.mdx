# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 0.11.2 compared to 0.11.1. Please read it carefully.

### `sys/seal-status` behavior change

The `sys/seal-status` endpoint now includes an initialized boolean in the
output. If Vault is not initialized, it will return a 200 with this value
set false instead of a 400

### Mount config passthrough headers

The mount config option for `passthrough_request_headers` will now deny
certain headers from being provided to backends based on a global denylist.
